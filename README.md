# S.A.F.A.R.I.

I made this project in 2017 by libgdx and java for android platform. Openning of S.A.F.A.R.I. is Stay Away From Astroids.

This game is basicly an endless side scrolling shoot em up game. Player controls an space ship which has unique properties like speed and shooting power. Player needs to avoid astroids coming from right side of screen to stay alive. Most of the time you cannot shoot astroids but at certain times firing power ability can be use after picking power up between astroids. At this limited time player can shoot astroids. And space ship has limited fuel to run, player needs to collect fuel tanks spawned in world and when space ship outs of power, player dies. Player can buy another ships by coins collected during gameplay or watching ads.
